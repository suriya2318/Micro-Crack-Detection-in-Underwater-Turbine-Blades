# Micro-Crack-Detection-in-Underwater-Turbine-Blades
This project uses Orange to detect micro-cracks in underwater turbine blades caused by biofilm corrosion. It includes data preprocessing, regression, classification, and association rule mining. The system predicts crack growth and suggests maintenance actions, helping reduce energy loss and costs.
