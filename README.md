# Ocean Turbine Blade – Micro-Crack Detection Using Orange
## Project Objective
To develop a predictive system that detects micro-cracks in underwater tidal turbine blades caused by biofilm corrosion using Orange Data Mining and machine learning techniques. The goal is to reduce energy loss and unplanned maintenance costs while supporting sustainable ocean energy generation.

## Problem Statement 
Underwater tidal turbine blades are prone to micro-cracks caused by biofilm corrosion.

These cracks: 

• Reduce energy output by 25%, leading to significant revenue loss. 

• Cause $500K/month in unplanned maintenance costs. 

• Are influenced by factors like microbial species, seawater pH, salinity, and stress levels. 

The challenge is to detect, predict, and prevent these cracks to enable predictive 
maintenance, reduce costs, and improve energy efficiency. 

## Solution 
The solution involves using Orange, an open-source data mining tool, to analyze and predict crack growth in underwater turbine blades. The workflow includes: 

 • Data Integration: Combining sonar scans, seawater pH data, and microbial genomic sequences. 
 
 • Feature Engineering: Reducing high-dimensional microbial genomic data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
 
 • Association Rule Mining: Identifying relationships between biofilm species and crack formation. 
 
 • Predictive Modeling: Using regression and classification models to predict crack growth and categorize risk levels. 
 
 • Real-Time Dashboard: Visualizing trends and risk levels for proactive decisionmaking.

## Dataset Used
